# Sustainabot
Sustainabot is a mini robot printer that uses everyday materials to create shapes and patterns.

The robot's 3D-printed body designs, circuit layouts, microcontroller code and accompanying Android app source code will be made available later in 2018 when existing deployments and refinements are completed.

Until then, see the [toolkit website](http://digitalinclusiontoolkit.org/) and [research project website](http://www.reshapingthefuture.org/) for more details and related work.
