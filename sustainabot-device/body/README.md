# Sustainabot body
Sustainabot's body is made primarily from 3D-printed parts, with a laser-cut wheel adapter and a vinyl insert that helps material to flow smoothly.

The body is made up of the following components:
* The [main housing](body-main.stl), which holds all of the circuitry and electronics.
* A [chute cover](body-chute-cover.stl), which allows the chute motor to control material flow
* A [cable cover](body-cable-cover.stl), which tidies away all connecting wires.
* A [switch](body-switch-cover.stl), which enlarges the onboard on/off toggle to provide easier control.
* A [shelf](body-shelf.stl) and [cover](body-hopper-cover.stl), which keep all of the electonics enclosed, and make it easy to pour in printing material.
* A [wheel adapter](wheel-adapter.svg), which connects the LEGO wheels to the drive motors.
* A [vinyl insert](hopper-insert.svg), which makes a smooth internal surface to help with material flow.

In addition to the printed and laser-cut components listed above, and the [circuit board](../controller) (with its component parts, motors, battery and Bluetooth board), you will also need the following:
* A 6.35mm (1/4in) ceramic Si3N4 bearing ([example](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073XK257W))
* Two Ø15mm×6mm LEGO wheels (example [tyre](https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-tire-15-x-6mm-with-offset-tread-band-around-center-of-tread-87414) and [rim](https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-wheel-rim-8-x-6-4-without-side-notch-4624))
* Three small screws to secure the cable cover (though tape will also suffice)
* A metal stopper insert (to align the chute cover) – in our devices this was simply a small nail driven into its main body
